The automation tower defense RTS, written in Java.


*This is a clone just from [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) v154*

## Changes

### [OK] only PC , no android nor ios.

### [half done] decouple from JDK 17, make it compilable and playable using new JDK like JDK25.
	
	using pre-built `Arc` and `annotations`, build from src of `core` and `desktop(launcher)`
	
	notes: `annotations` using com.sun to polluted the dependency.
	
	later maybe figure out what annotations is used for and replace it with `common` ways.
	
	also pre-built `annotations` may cause issue if want to modify the related raw.
	
	since the task is trival and less interesting, put it later maybe.

### change the game play into `my way`

- [TODO] add auto AI to making belts
- [TODO] any others...
